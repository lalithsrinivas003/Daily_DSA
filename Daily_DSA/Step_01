==================================================
ðŸ“… Day 1 - Step 1 : Basics of Java & For Loops
==================================================

Activities:
- Revised Java basics (variables, data types, and input/output).  
- Practiced for loops by solving multiple problems.  
- Completed 22 different pattern programs using nested loops (stars, numbers, and mixed patterns).  

Outcome:
- Strengthened understanding of loops in Java.  
- Improved logic-building skills through pattern problems.  
- Gained more confidence in problem-solving with iterative approaches.
