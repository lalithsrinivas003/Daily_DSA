I'M Following Striver a2z Sheet
==================================================
ðŸ“… Day 1 - Step 1 : Basics of Java & For Loops
==================================================

Activities:
- Revised Java basics (variables, data types, and input/output).  
- Practiced for loops by solving multiple problems.  
- Completed 22 different pattern programs using nested loops (stars, numbers, and mixed patterns).  

Outcome:
- Strengthened understanding of loops in Java.  
- Improved logic-building skills through pattern problems.  
- Gained more confidence in problem-solving with iterative approaches. 






==================================================
ðŸ“… Day 2 - Step 1 : Basic Math Problems (Striver A2Z)
==================================================
Activities:
- Practiced problems on numbers and basic mathematics in Java.
- Implemented programs for:
  â€¢ Prime Number check  
  â€¢ Greatest Common Factor (GCD)  
  â€¢ Printing all Divisors of a number  
  â€¢ Armstrong Number check  
  â€¢ Palindrome check  
  â€¢ Counting digits in a number  
  â€¢ Reversing a number  

Outcome:
- Strengthened problem-solving using loops and conditionals.  
- Gained confidence in applying mathematical logic with Java.  
- Improved coding speed for beginner-level math-based problems. 





==================================================
ðŸ“… Day 3 - Step 1 : Understanding Recursion (Striver A2Z)
==================================================
Activities:
- Learned the basics of recursion and how function calls work.
- Practiced simple recursion problems in Java:
  â€¢ Print something N times  
  â€¢ Print name N times using recursion  
  â€¢ Print numbers from 1 to N  
  â€¢ Print numbers from N to 1  
  â€¢ Find the sum of first N natural numbers  

Outcome:
- Gained clarity on how recursion replaces loops in certain problems.  
- Understood the concept of base case and recursive case.  
- Built a foundation for solving more advanced recursion problems.
